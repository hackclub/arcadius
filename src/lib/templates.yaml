    Welcome hacker, it’s so good to see you! You know what this means, right? You’ve made it to Step 2 of the Hack Club Arcade! :summer::joystick:

    1. *Join the Slack ✓*
    2. *Hack on Projects* ← _You are here_
    3. Get Cool Stuff

    Hack Club is a rather _big_ place, this Arcade is just one little piece of it. I would show you around, but these old dinosaur bones don’t move like they used to…

    My dear friend <@U078FB76K5F> can give you a tour though!

    Good job with Step 2! When you earn minutes for real, there's one more step where you have to exchange those minutes for tickets. We can go over that later though… for now, here's 3 free tickets so you can skip to the good part.

    1. *Join the Slack ✓*
    2. *Hack on Projects ✓*
    3. *Get Cool Stuff* ← _You are here_

    *To spend your tickets, run `/shop`*

    You have _arrived._ Step 3 is complete, your prize is on its way :gift:

    1. *Join the Slack ✓*

    3. *Get Cool Stuff ✓* (`/shop`)

    This is just the beginning. You have all summer to keep logging hours and claiming prizes! The Arcade closes on August 31st.
