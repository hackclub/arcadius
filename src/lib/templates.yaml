    Welcome hacker, it’s so good to see you! You know what this means, right? You’ve made it to Step 2 of the Hack Club Arcade! :summer::joystick:

    1. *Join the Slack ✓*
    2. *Hack on Projects* ← _You are here_
    3. Get Cool Stuff

    Hack Club is a rather _big_ place, this Arcade is just one little piece of it. I would show you around, but these old dinosaur bones don’t move like they used to…

    My dear friend <@U078FB76K5F> can give you a tour though!
